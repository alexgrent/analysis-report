overrepresentation=This is an overrepresentation analysis: a statistical (hypergeometric distribution) test that determines whether certain Reactome pathways are over-represented (enriched) in the submitted data. It answers the question ‘Does my list contain more proteins for pathway X than would be expected by chance?’ This test produces a probability score, which is corrected for false discovery rate using the Benjamani-Hochberg method.
expression=This is an overrepresentation analysis: The numbers are used to produce a scaled coloured overlay over Reactome pathway diagrams, as a means to visualize relative expression levels. Note that the numeric values do not have to be expression data, for instance by using gene association scores the same analysis can be used to visualize genotyping results
species_comparison=This is a species comparison analysis: compares human pathways with computationally-predicted pathways in model organisms, highlighting the elements of the pathway that are common to both species and those that may be absent in the model organism.

identifiers.found=%d out of %d identifiers in the sample were found in Reactome, where %d pathways were hit by at least one of them.
projected=All non-human identifiers have been converted to their human equivalent.

interactors=IntAct interactors were included to increase the analysis background. This greatly increases the size of Reactome pathways, which maximises the chances of matching your submitted identifiers to the expanded pathway, but will include interactors that have not undergone manual curation by Reactome and may include interactors that have no biological significance, or unexplained relevance.
target.species=This report is filtered to show only results and pathway diagrams for %s.
token=The unique ID for this analysis (token) is %s. This ID is valid for at least 7 days in Reactome’s server. Use it to access Reactome services with your data.
fireworks.caption=This figure shows a genome-wide overview of the results of your pathway analysis. Reactome pathways are arranged in a hierarchy. The center of each of the circular "bursts" is the root of one top-level pathway, for example "DNA Repair". Each step away from the center represents the next level lower in the pathway hierarchy. The color code denotes over-representation of that pathway in your input dataset. Light grey signifies pathways which are not significantly over-represented.
